1. C++11 and C++14 topics include:
(1) The pros and cons of braced initialization,noexcept speci cations, perfect forwarding, and smart pointer make functions
(2) The relationships among std::move,std::forward,rvalue references, and universal references
(3) Techniques for writing clear,correct,effective lambda expressions
(4) How std::atomic differs from volatile, how each should be used, and how they relate to C++'s concurrency API
(5) How best practices in "old" C++ programming(i.e.,C++98) require revision for software development in modern C++

auto, range-based for loops, lambda, rvalue referece, concurrency, smart pointers, moving vs copying, std::atomic vs volatile

2. C++ version 

C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14

Comparision:

C++98 
(1) lacks support for concurrency


C++11 
(1) supports lambda expressions
(2) pervasive feature is move semantics

example:
Widget: small devices

void someFunc(Widget w)

Widget wid;
someFunc(wid);				// w is copy of wid created via copy construction
someFunc(std::move(wid));	// w is copy of wid created via move construction



C++14 
(1) offers generalized function return type deduction
